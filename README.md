# Mission Control - OpenClaw Ops Console

Mission Control is the local operator console for OpenClaw. It runs at
`http://127.0.0.1:3333` and gives one fast surface for active sessions, cron
jobs, cost usage, local models, Digital Office state, governance history, and
runtime health.

This app is meant to answer the operator question first: what is running, what
needs attention, what changed recently, and which action is safe to take next.

## Current Version

The current release is an operator-focused overhaul:

- **Dashboard / Operator Briefing** - active calls, live session counts, channel
  heartbeat, evidence feed, quick actions, and "needs attention" signals.
- **Cost Tracker** - OpenClaw + Hermes usage, budget posture, model/service
  breakdowns, and fast cached responses with background refresh fallback.
- **Cron Jobs + Calendar** - recurring job status, failed/overdue jobs, compact
  model display, manual run/toggle controls, and schedule-oriented scanning.
- **Governance Archive** - read-only view of council/governance records. Council
  mutations are disabled by default because the old council flow was not earning
  its operational weight.
- **Digital Office / Team Structure / Agent Hub** - office telemetry, desks,
  active sessions, team registry, runtime ownership, and agent attention cues.
- **Ollama Monitor** - local model inventory, health, memory posture, and tuning
  surfaces for local LLM operations.
- **Memory / Scout / AWS / Settings** - supporting diagnostics and configuration
  surfaces kept available where useful.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- An OpenClaw workspace on the same machine
- Optional: Brave Search API key for Scout
- Optional: local Ollama install for the Ollama Monitor page

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ykcoatepe/mission-control.git
cd mission-control

npm install
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

cp mc-config.default.json mc-config.json
npm start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3333`.

The Setup page can auto-detect the local OpenClaw config and write
`mc-config.json`. Keep `mc-config.json` local; it is intentionally gitignored.

## Runtime Data

Mission Control intentionally keeps live operator state out of git:

- `mc-config.json` - local app configuration
- `data/` - runtime snapshots and local state
- `tasks.json` - local workshop/task queue state
- `logs/` and `*.log` - server/runtime logs
- `frontend/dist/` - generated frontend build
- `node_modules/` and `frontend/node_modules/` - installed dependencies

Do not commit live OpenClaw, Hermes, token, or personal runtime data.

## Configuration

Common environment switches:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PORT` | Override the default `3333` server port |
| `MC_USER_HOME` | Explicit host home for OpenClaw usage lookups |
| `MC_OPENCLAW_USAGE_TIMEOUT_MS` | Timeout for OpenClaw usage summary collection |
| `MISSION_CONTROL_ENABLE_COUNCIL_ACTIONS=1` | Re-enable council action endpoints |

Council action endpoints return `410 Gone` unless
`MISSION_CONTROL_ENABLE_COUNCIL_ACTIONS=1` is set. Keep the default archive-only
mode unless a real OpenClaw operation needs active council mutations again.

```

**Stack:** React 19, Vite 7, TypeScript, Framer Motion, Recharts, lucide-react,
and Express.

The backend favors bounded reads, cached snapshots, and explicit fallbacks so the
UI remains useful when a slow runtime source stalls. User-facing health should
come from evidence-bearing API responses, not from optimistic labels alone.

## Validation

Useful local checks:

```bash
npm run build
cd frontend && npm run build
node --check server.js
node --check server/routes/costs.js
```

For UI changes, verify the running app at `http://127.0.0.1:3333` and inspect
the relevant API endpoint directly with `curl`.

## Feature Notes

- Dashboard should remain compact and decision-first. Avoid decorative surfaces
  that make runtime state harder to scan.
- Cost Tracker should continue to return a usable fallback quickly, then refresh
  richer OpenClaw/Hermes usage in the background.
- Governance Archive is intentionally quieter than the old council workflow. If
  the council becomes operationally useful again, improve and re-enable it behind
  the existing environment gate.
- Skills is still available as a direct route but hidden from navigation while
  it has no meaningful operator workflow.
