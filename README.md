# 🖥️ Mission Control — Dashboard for OpenClaw

**Your AI agent deserves a cockpit.**

Mission Control is a sleek, macOS-native-feel web dashboard for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) — the open-source AI agent framework. Monitor your agent's activity, manage cron jobs, discover opportunities, chat in real-time, and keep costs under control — all from one beautiful interface.

> Built by an OpenClaw power user who got tired of SSHing into servers to check what his agent was doing.

## ✨ Why Mission Control?

OpenClaw agents are powerful — but they run headless. You're stuck checking logs, reading JSONL transcripts, and running CLI commands to know what's happening. Mission Control changes that:

- **See everything at a glance** — sessions, tokens, channels, heartbeat status
- **Talk to your agent** — streaming chat widget on every page (Intercom-style)
- **Delegate work** — queue tasks, let sub-agents research, review reports
- **Stay on budget** — track token usage and costs across all sessions
- **Find opportunities** — Scout Engine auto-searches for gigs, grants, skills, and news
- **Manage schedules** — create, toggle, run, and delete cron jobs visually
- **One-click actions** — check emails, review calendar, run heartbeats

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) installed and running
- Node.js 18+
- A Brave Search API key (for Scout — [free tier available](https://brave.com/search/api/))

### Install

```bash
# Clone into your OpenClaw workspace
git clone https://github.com/Jzineldin/mission-control.git
cd mission-control

# Install dependencies
npm install
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..

# Configure
cp mc-config.default.json mc-config.json

# Start
node server.js
```

Visit `http://localhost:3333` — the **Setup Wizard** will auto-detect your OpenClaw config and guide you through the rest.

### Production (systemd)

```bash
sudo cp mission-control.service /etc/systemd/system/
# Edit the service file with your paths
sudo systemctl enable --now mission-control
```

### Configuration

Mission Control auto-detects your setup:
- **Gateway token** from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- **Agent name** from `IDENTITY.md`
- **Model, channels, workspace** from OpenClaw config

Fine-tune everything via `mc-config.json` or the Settings page in the UI.
