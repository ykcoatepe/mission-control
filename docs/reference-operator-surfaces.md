# Operator Surfaces Reference

This reference describes the public routes, API endpoints, local commands, and safety behavior of the Mission Control operator surfaces.

## Browser Routes

| Route | Page | Data source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Dashboard | `/api/status`, `/api/activity`, `/api/sessions`, `/api/costs` | Operator briefing, active sessions, heartbeat, attention signals, and evidence feed |
| `/office` | Digital Office | `/api/office/telemetry` | Desk telemetry, priority lane, attention queue, and office session state |
| `/cron` | Cron Jobs | `/api/cron`, `/api/models` | OpenClaw and Hermes cron visibility with scheduler-specific actions |
| `/conversations` | Conversations | `/api/sessions/*`, `/api/chat/*` | Session browser and transcript review |
| `/workshop` | Workshop | `/api/tasks/*`, `/api/quick/*` | Local task board and execution queue |
| `/kanban` | Hermes Kanban | `/api/hermes-kanban` | Hermes task board with detail drawer and bounded write actions |
| `/costs` | Cost Tracker | `/api/costs`, `/api/costs/codexbar` | OpenClaw, Hermes, and CodexBar usage with source reliability metadata |
| `/calendar` | Calendar | `/api/calendar`, `/api/cron` | Schedule-first view of recurring work and calendar entries |
| `/gbrain` | GBrain | `/api/gbrain/overview` | Proof-backed view of GBrain trust, sources, queues, and bridge caveats |
| `/diagnostics` | Diagnostics | `/api/config` plus selected tab endpoints | Tabbed support surface for Memory, Docs, Scout, AWS, and Skills |
| `/ollama` | Ollama Monitor | `/api/ollama/*`, `/api/costs` | Local model telemetry plus model token usage context |
| `/team` | Team Structure | `/api/team/structure`, `/api/models` | Team registry, role grouping, bootstrap state, and model ownership view |
| `/agents` | Agent Hub | `/api/agents/*`, `/api/sessions` | Active agents, runtime inventory, and session detail |
| `/settings` | Settings | `/api/config`, `/api/settings/*`, `/api/models` | Gateway configuration, model routing, and local preferences |
| `/councils` | Governance Archive | `/api/councils/*` | Read-only governance and council history |

Legacy routes:

| Route | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `/memory` | Redirects to `/diagnostics?tab=memory` |
| `/scout` | Redirects to `/diagnostics?tab=scout` |
| `/aws` | Redirects to `/diagnostics?tab=aws` |
| `/skills` | Redirects to `/diagnostics?tab=skills` |

`/diagnostics` hides any tab whose module flag is explicitly `false` in
`mc-config.json`. If the requested `?tab=` is hidden or unknown, it selects the
first visible tab.

## Server Runtime

Mission Control is an Express server that serves the generated Vite build from
`frontend/dist`.

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `3333` | Local HTTP port for the server and same-origin checks |
| `MISSION_CONTROL_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address for the HTTP listener |

Health endpoints:

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Returns `{ ok, status, service, generatedAt }` |
| `GET` | `/healthz` | Same health payload for simple process probes |

Request guardrails:

- `Host` must be one of `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or the same values with the
  active `PORT`.
- `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests with an `Origin` header must
  come from `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` on the active `PORT`.
- `/data/*` is not served statically; it returns `404` JSON.
- Non-API browser routes fall through to `frontend/dist/index.html` so React
  Router can handle deep links.

## GBrain API

GBrain probe endpoints are read-only. `GET /api/gbrain/actions` exposes the
safe action catalog, and `POST /api/gbrain/actions` is a bounded local
maintenance surface with an explicit action allowlist.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/gbrain/overview` | Returns the cockpit, nodes, edges, caveats, and live probe payloads used by `/gbrain` |
| `GET` | `/api/gbrain/health` | Runs `gbrain health --json` and `gbrain jobs stats --json`, then normalizes health, embeddings, and queue counters |
| `GET` | `/api/gbrain/sources` | Runs `gbrain sources list --json`, falling back to `gbrain sources list` text parsing |
| `GET` | `/api/gbrain/version` | Runs `gbrain --version` and normalizes the active CLI version |
| `GET` | `/api/gbrain/integration-health` | Runs live GBrain tool/feature/source probes and reports Hermes/OpenClaw integration readiness |
| `GET` | `/api/gbrain/actions` | Returns the allowlisted action catalog rendered by `/gbrain` |
| `POST` | `/api/gbrain/actions` | Runs one allowlisted local maintenance action and returns redacted command evidence |

Runtime details:

- Command timeout: `7000` ms.
- PATH includes `~/.bun/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, then the process PATH.
- Error messages redact bearer tokens, `sk-` API keys, and `/Users/<name>` paths.
- Live failure returns JSON with `ok: false`, `mode: live-read-only`, `status: unavailable`, `checkedAt`, and a redacted `error`.
- Read probes prove current health, source, queue, and bridge state only. Repair
  proof comes from the allowlisted action response and the follow-up overview
  refresh.

Supported action payloads for `POST /api/gbrain/actions`:

| Action | CLI effect |
| --- | --- |
| `doctor-fast` | `gbrain doctor --json --fast` |
| `preview-sync` | `gbrain sync --all --no-pull --parallel 1 --dry-run --json --yes` |
| `sync-sources` | `gbrain sync --all --no-pull --parallel 1 --timeout 105 --json --yes && gbrain embed --stale` |
| `retry-failed-sync` | `gbrain sync --all --retry-failed --serial --timeout 105 --no-pull --json --yes && gbrain embed --stale` |
| `embed-stale` | `gbrain embed --stale` |
| `embed-missing` | `gbrain embed --stale --priority recent --batch-size 1000` |
| `check-resolvable` | `gbrain check-resolvable --json` |
| `storage-status` | `gbrain storage status --json` |

Action safety constraints:

- No arbitrary command or source id is accepted from the browser.
- Only one GBrain action may run at a time from Mission Control.
- Action timeout is action-specific: 30000 ms for fast diagnostics, 60000 ms
  for previews and routing checks, 120000 ms for normal maintenance or repair,
  and 1800000 ms for `embed-missing`.
- Long repairs use a soft timeout first: Mission Control sends SIGINT, reports
  `status: timed-out` with `pending: true`, and keeps the action slot busy until
  the process exits or the hard-kill delay expires.
- Action output uses the same token, key, and home-path redaction as probes.

The overview payload has these top-level fields:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ok` | boolean | Whether the overview model was built |
| `mode` | string | `live-read-only` when live probes were attempted, otherwise `read-only-fixture` |
| `refreshedAt` | ISO string | Live probe time or saved audit timestamp |
| `trust` | object | Global label, status, score, proof source, and timestamp |
| `cockpit` | object | Metric cards keyed by health, embeddings, queue, autopilot, bridge, and caveats |
| `nodes` | array | Brain map nodes with proof, metrics, risks, and next safe action |
| `edges` | array | Relationships between nodes and proof node ids |
| `caveats` | array | Known caveats that do not invalidate the whole surface |
| `integrationContract` | object | Shared-brain contract: GBrain is the cross-system brain while Hermes and OpenClaw keep their local memory systems |
| `integrationHealth` | object | Live matrix for GBrain core tools, feature gaps, MCP config, runtime contract install, source freshness, and read/write smoke proof |
| `live` | object | Raw normalized live health and source probe results |

Node status values are `healthy`, `warning`, `critical`, and `inactive`.

Memory integration boundary:

- GBrain is the shared machine brain for cross-system recall, source search,
  graph context, and curated durable knowledge.
- Hermes profile memory and OpenClaw native memory remain their local/private
  runtime memory systems.
- Only curated decisions, playbooks, handoffs, and verified task outcomes should
  be promoted into GBrain.
- Raw transcripts, secrets, credentials, and untagged private memory must not be
  mirrored into GBrain.

Core tool contract:

- Hermes and OpenClaw should treat `get_page`, `put_page`, `query`, `recall`,
  `sources`, and `health` as the baseline GBrain shared-brain surface.
- Mission Control verifies this with `gbrain --tools-json`; the canonical MCP
  tool ids are `get_page`, `put_page`, `query`, `recall`,
  `sources_list`, and `get_health`.
- `think` is provider-backed synthesis, not a baseline read capability.
  Mission Control shows a separate Think runtime warning until GBrain has an
  active `chat_model`, `models.think`, `GBRAIN_MODEL`, or provider proxy base
  URL plus live health proof. Tool discovery alone is not enough to call
  `think` operational.
- Mission Control verifies runtime guidance separately, so MCP connectivity is
  not confused with Hermes/OpenClaw actually being instructed to use GBrain for
  shared recall/search/writeback when appropriate.
- `put_page` remains scoped to curated cross-system memory. It is not a raw
  transcript or credential mirror.
- `gbrain features --json` recommendations with id `no-integrations` are shown
  as optional external recipes. They remain visible, but they do not downgrade
  Hermes/OpenClaw core shared-brain health.

## Hermes Kanban API

Mission Control shells out to:

```bash
hermes --profile PROFILE kanban ...
```

The profile is selected from `HERMES_PROFILE`, `mcConfig.hermes.profile`, or `hmudur`.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/hermes-kanban` | Lists all board columns, stats, assignees, and summary counts |
| `GET` | `/api/hermes-kanban/tasks/:taskId` | Shows one task with normalized events, comments, and runs |
| `POST` | `/api/hermes-kanban/actions` | Runs one bounded Kanban action |

Supported action payloads for `POST /api/hermes-kanban/actions`:

| Action | Required fields | Optional fields | CLI effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `create` | `title` | `body`, `assignee`, `workspace`, `tenant`, `priority`, `triage`, `skills` | `kanban create ... --created-by mission-control --json` |
| `assign` | `taskId`, `assignee` | none | `kanban assign TASK_ID ASSIGNEE` |
| `comment` | `taskId`, `text` | none | `kanban comment --author mission-control TASK_ID TEXT` |
| `block` | `taskId` | `reason` | `kanban block TASK_ID REASON` |
| `unblock` | `taskId` | none | `kanban unblock TASK_ID` |
| `archive` | `taskId` | none | `kanban archive TASK_ID` |
| `dispatch` | none | none | `kanban dispatch --max 1 --json` |

Safety constraints:

- `taskId`, `title`, `assignee`, `workspace`, `tenant`, and `skill` values cannot start with `-`.
- The action timeout is normally `15000` ms.
- `dispatch` uses a `30000` ms timeout.

## Cron API

The cron surface merges OpenClaw jobs and Hermes profile jobs into one API shape.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/cron` | Returns cached or live cron jobs |
| `POST` | `/api/cron/:id/toggle` | Enables or disables OpenClaw or Hermes jobs |
| `POST` | `/api/cron/:id/run` | Runs an OpenClaw job |
| `POST` | `/api/cron/create` | Creates an OpenClaw cron job |
| `DELETE` | `/api/cron/:id` | Deletes an OpenClaw job |
| `PATCH` | `/api/cron/:id/model` | Updates an OpenClaw model/thinking setting or a Hermes model setting |

Job ids are normalized as:

```text
openclaw:<sourceId>
hermes:<sourceId>
```

If the prefix is missing, Mission Control treats the job as OpenClaw unless a scheduler hint is provided.

Hermes action matrix:

| Action | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| Toggle enabled state | Yes |
| Update model | Yes |
| Update thinking | No |
| Run now | No |
| Delete | No |

Hermes model aliases:

| Input | Stored provider/model/base URL |
| --- | --- |
| `ollama/qwen3.6:35b-a3b-nvfp4` | `custom`, `qwen3.6:35b-a3b-nvfp4`, `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` |
| `custom/qwen3.6:35b-a3b-nvfp4` | `custom`, `qwen3.6:35b-a3b-nvfp4`, `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` |
| `openai/gpt-5.5` | `openai-codex`, `openai/gpt-5.5`, no base URL |
| `openai-codex/openai/gpt-5.5` | `openai-codex`, `openai/gpt-5.5`, no base URL |

## Costs API

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/costs?period=day|7d|month` | Returns combined OpenClaw and Hermes usage |
| `GET` | `/api/costs/codexbar` | Returns CodexBar usage when local data is available |

Cost collection behavior:

- OpenClaw usage runs through `scripts/openclaw-usage-summary.js`.
- Default OpenClaw timeout is `120000` ms and can be overridden with `MC_OPENCLAW_USAGE_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- Hermes usage reads the active profile SQLite state database.
- Detailed results are cached in `MC_COSTS_CACHE_DIR` or the OS temp directory.
- If a refresh is already running, the API returns the best cached result with `meta.refreshing: true`.
- If OpenClaw is unavailable but previous detailed OpenClaw data exists, Mission Control preserves it and marks `meta.stale: true`.

Cost normalization rules:

- Local models and subscription-included GPT-5.5 usage are not treated as billable spend.
- Implausible micro-cost cloud rows are normalized to included spend.
- Unknown zero-cost cloud models remain `unknown`, not estimated spend.
- Estimated daily spend is only applied to rows with tokens for that day.

## CI Gates

Two workflows run on every PR and push to `master`:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `backend-tests` (root `npm test`, the full
  `tests/` suite via `node --test`) and `frontend-checks` (`npm run lint`,
  then `npm run build` which type-checks with `tsc -b` and builds with Vite).
- `.github/workflows/supply-chain.yml` — the npm incident gate described below.

### Supply-chain gate

`scripts/check-npm-supply-chain.mjs`:

- Fetches `NPM_INCIDENT_ADVISORY_URL`, defaulting to the Snyk TanStack/Mini Shai-Hulud advisory page.
- Extracts exact npm package and version indicators from embedded Nuxt JavaScript.
- Scans `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, and `yarn.lock`.
- Fails only on exact malicious package/version matches.
- Fails closed when no npm indicators can be parsed.

The supply-chain workflow also runs:

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
(cd frontend && npm ci --ignore-scripts)
npm audit signatures
(cd frontend && npm audit signatures)
```
